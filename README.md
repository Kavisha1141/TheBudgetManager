# My Personal Project: The Budget Manager

## User-friendly tool designed to help manage budget and finances!

The goal of the project is to create a simple budget manager for students to 
keep track of their finances. In the world we live in today, finances play a
**HUGE ROLE**, especially for students learning to be financially independent.
College students are exposed to new responsibilities such as buying groceries,
paying bills, rent, *STUDENT LOANS* and balancing their wants with their needs.  
Learning all of this, on their own, can be difficult.

In this learning process, technology can be a powerful tool. Because of this reason,
I came up with Budget Manager. Through Budget Manager, students can keep track of their income, 
expenses, and saving goals.  


*The Budget Manager* User Stories:
- I want to be able to add my **income, expenses and savings**
- I want to be able to set a **target amount** for my **savings** 
- I want to be able to view my money spend in total, my savings in total, and my income left
- I want to be able to view a user report of all expenses, earnings, savings and balance
- I want to be able to save my account info into a file
- I want to be able to reload previously saved account info from my accounts


*Instructions for end user*:
- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by pressing the button "Add an expense"/"Add an earning" in the earnings/expenses tab
- You can generate the second required action using "Update info" button in dashboard which shows total expenses/earnings and remaining balance
- You can generate the third required action related to the user story "viewing Xs in Y" by going into the expense/earnings tab and pressing "update earnings report" and "update expenses report" button.
- You can locate my visual component by the splashscreen before the app launches and the progress bar in the dashboard
- You can save the state of my application by pressing the save info to file button in dashboard
- You can reload the state of my application by pressing the load from file button in the login console
