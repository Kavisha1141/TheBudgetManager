# My Personal Project: The Budget Manager

## User-friendly tool designed to help manage budget and finances!

The goal of the project is to create a simple budget manager for students to 
keep track of their finances. In the world we live in today, finances play a
**HUGE ROLE**, especially for students learning to be financially independent.
College students are exposed to new responsibilities such as buying groceries,
paying bills, rent, *STUDENT LOANS* and balancing their wants with their needs.  
And learning all of this, on their own, can be difficult.

In this learning process, technology can be a powerful tool. Because of this reason,
I came up with Budget Manager. Through Budget Manager, students can keep track of their income, 
expenses, and saving goals.  


*The Budget Manager* User Stories:
- I want to be able to add my **income, expenses and savings**
- I want to be able to set a **target** for my **savings** percent-wise
- I want to be able to view my money spend in total, my savings in total, and my income left
