# My Personal Project
# Budget Manager

## Manage your finances your way!

The goal of the project is to create a simple budget manager for students to 
keep track of their finances. In the world we live in today, finances play a
**HUGE ROLE**, especially for students learning to be financially independent.
College students are exposed to new responsibilities such as buying groceries,
paying bills, rent, **STUDENT LOANS** and balancing their wants with their needs.  
And learning all of this, on their own, can be difficult. W

In this learning process, technology can be a powerful tool. Because of this reason,
I came up with Budget Manager. Through Budget Manager, students can keep track of their income, 
expenses, and saving goals.  


A *The Budget Manager* will allow the user to:
- Add their **income, expenses and savings**
- Set a **target** for their **savings** percent-wise
- **Add/remove log entries** to keep track of all expenses
